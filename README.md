### What I Learned 
In this project, I learned how to organize my code through the use of objects and the ability to create them using constructors. Furthermore, I greatly enhanced my DOM manipulation skills by creating my very first CRUD application through the use of vanilla Javascript. I learned various techniques required to create, read, update, and delete different elements and attributes using DOM.
